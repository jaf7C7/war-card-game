* 2 to 10 inclusive

* Ace (14)

There are 4 suits:

* Spades

There are 2 players:
* Human player
* Computer player


## How to play

1. At the start of the game each player receives 26 cards from a shuffled
   52-card deck.
2. Each player draws the top card from their deck.
3. The player whose card has the highest value wins the round. Suits are
   ignored.
4. The winner places both cards at the bottom of their deck.
5. If the values of both cards are equal, then the war begins:
   1. Each player draws 3 cards from their deck *face down* and then a 4th
      card *face up*.
   2. The 4th cards are compared and the player whose card has the highest
      value wins.
   3. The winner takes *all* the cards (8 total) and places them at the bottom
      of their deck.
   4. If there is another tie the process continues until a winner is found
      (you can win a *lot* of cards!).
